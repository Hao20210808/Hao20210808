My name is Hao-Zhong, Yang. Iâ€™m
a third year student in the Computer
Science Internet Engineering department
of Tamkang University. The opportunity to
become interested in information was
when I took elective courses in high
school. I participated in laser cutting,
Arduino and radio operations. It was also
the first time that I obtained a professional
license at NCC (National Communications
Commission) with my friend. [Figure.1] It
was just that I completed the steps in
sequence according to the instructions of
the instructor at that time, which was my
initial understanding of the information.
However, observing that through these
processes, people still have to operate the
physical equipment in person, and the
hardware may be just a window for the
interaction between the software and
humans, and it is still the software that
actually executes the calculation process,
so I thought the software may be the core
of every electronic devices at that time. So
I decided to study Information
Engineering.
